Building a card game named Quasar in python 

Quasar is a futuristic version of Blackjack featured in the Mass Effect video game series. Its rules are simpler to implement than Blackjack, but it has the same general idea. 
The player makes a bet and receives an initial score. At each step, the player can draw a value or stand.

If the player’s score goes over 20, the player goes bust and loses the bet.
If the player’s score is under 15, the player also loses the bet.
If the player hits 20 exactly, this is Quasar and the player doubles the bet.
If the player’s score is 15-19, the player earns back some or all of the bet.

The big difference between Blackjack and Quasar is that the player draws numbers, not cards. At each stage, the player can choose to get a random number 1-8, or a random number 4-7. 
This allows the player a little more control than the hit-or-stand of Blackjack

The goal of this game was to emphasize technique in using python while-loop function
